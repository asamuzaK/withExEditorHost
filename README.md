# withExEditorHost
Native messaging host for Firefox add-on [withExEditor] (https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/withexeditor/ "withExEditor :: Add-ons for Firefox")

## Download the host

Download a zip file or tar.gz file of the source code from [Releases Â· asamuzaK/withExEditorHost] (https://github.com/asamuzaK/withExEditorHost/releases), save it in an arbitrary place after decompressing (for example, `C:\Users\XXX\withExEditorHost\`).
If you have a Github account, you can also clone and save the repository.

Note that the host for withExEditor runs with [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/), so if you do not have Node.js, please install it.

## Setting up the host

There are configuration file samples in `_config` folder of withExEditorHost.

Create a copy of the `_config` folder and rename it to `config`.
Please do not edit the contents of the `_config` folder directly.
It may be overwritten when updating withExEditorHost.

The `config` folder can be saved in an arbitrary place, but if you saved withExEditorHost from zip or tar.gz, just put it in the same place as the `_config`.
If you've cloned a repository, to prevent unintentionally uploading the `config` folder to GitHub, it is strongly recommend that you should save the `config` folder *outside* the repository, not inside.

### Edit the shell script

On Windows, open `withexeditorhost.cmd` and enter the path of the index.js file of the host.

```
@ Echo off
:: Fill in the path of the index.js file of the host.
node "C:\Users\XXX\withExEditorHost\index.js"
```

On Linux / Mac, open `withexeditorhost.sh` and enter the path of the index.js file of the host.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fill in the path of the index.js file of the host.
node /path/to/withexeditorhost/index.js
```

### Edit the application manifest

Open `withexeditorhost.json` and enter the path of the shell script in the `path` field in it.
Note that on Windows, it is necessary to escape backslashes, which is a directory delimiter, by adding an extra backslash.

Other fields are OK as is.

```
{
  "name": "withexeditorhost",
  "description": "Native messaging host for withExEditor",
  "path": "C:\\Users\\XXX\\withExEditorHost\\config\\withexeditorhost.cmd",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_extensions": ["jid1-WiAigu4HIo0Tag@jetpack"]
}
```

#### Windows

On Windows, you also need to set the registry.
You can save the registry key by executing the following command with cmd.exe.
Rewrite the `"C:\Users\XXX\withExEditorHosts\withexeditorhost.json"` part.

```
REG ADD "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\withexeditorhost" /ve /d "C:\Users\XXX\withExEditorHosts\config\withexeditorhost.json" /f
```

#### Linux / Mac

On Linux and Mac, you need to save the application manifest in the specified location.
For details, please refer to [App manifest location] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#App_manifest_location).

### Edit the editor configuration

Open `editorconfig.json` and fill in the information of the editor.

```
{
  "editorPath": "C:\\Program Files\\Path\\To\\Your\\Editor.exe",
  "cmdArgs": [],
  "fileAfterCmdArgs": false
}
```

* *editorPath* - The path of the editor to use. On Windows, please note that backslash characters must be escaped.
* *cmdArgs* - Array of command line options. Enter each argument inside bracket, separate them by comma. For example, `"cmdArgs": ["-a", "-b", "-c"]`
* *fileAfterCmdArgs* - Boolean (`true` / `false`). When specifying the file, some editor requires to put the file path after command arguments. Set `true` in such case.

***

After the above work, restart Firefox.

If you saved the `config` folder outside the host, you need to enter the path of `editorconfig.json` in the options page of withExEditor.
